# todo-app-vanilla-js
an exercise to feel the pain of building without a javascript framework

some observations
- yes it's a pain to manually create DOM elements and need to know where to stick them
- creating DOM elements directly makes it hard to visualize the DOM tree within the code
- you have to separately update the data and the DOM to reflect the data and I can see that becoming out of sync potentially
- because updating state and DOM elements are so intertwined, I have to spend some time thinking about how to organize the code so it's easier to read
